# zknote

### Securely share sensitive information with one-time access, no traces left behind.

**üåê Live Demo:** [https://zknote.cc](https://zknote.cc)

- Send ephemeral plaintext dead drops that self-destruct after being viewed
- Confidently share passwords, backup codes, or keys on untrusted platforms
- Store time-sensitive data with flexible expiration times

## Features

- **Zero Knowledge**: Client side AES-GCM 256 bit encryption
- **One-Time Access**: Messages are deleted on successful decryption
- **Ephemeral**: Set expiration windows from 1 minute to 1 week
- Optional passphrases and QR code generation

## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ianshapiro1/zknote.git

## Security

This is a zero-knowledge application where:
- All encryption/decryption happens in the browser
- The server never sees plaintext messages
- Keys are either derived from passphrases or generated randomly
- Messages are automatically deleted after successful decryption

## Deployment

This application is deployed on AWS using:
- **ECS Fargate** for container orchestration
- **RDS PostgreSQL** for data storage
- **Application Load Balancer** & **Auto-scaling**
- **HTTPS/SSL** via AWS Certificate Manager
